Entailment results (wbless)
---------------------------
CLASSICAL.txt, CLASSICAL_DBSCAN.txt, PROTOTYPE.txt, PROTOTYPE_DBSCAN.txt contain lexical entailment results of the following format:

concept_1	concept_2	t	p

Where "t" is the true entailment value (either 0 or 1 in wbless) and "p" is the predicted entailment value (continuous from 0 to 1)
With classical methods, "p" is the proportion instances of concept_1 that are in the convex hull of concept_2
With prototype methods, "p" is the pdf of the prototype of concept_1 with respect to the density function of concept_2
