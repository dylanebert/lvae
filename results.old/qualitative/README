Owls contains data for owls
Other refers to data for non-owl birds of prey

Txt files are of the format
filename	dist	dist_dbscan	p2	p64

Where dist is the distance to the classical owl boundary (negative distance is inside the boundary)
Dist_dbscan is the distance to the dbscan owl boundary
P2 is the prototypicality of the encoding against the owl normal
P64 is the prototypicality of the 64-dim encoding against the 64-dim owl normal

The json files are the same, but with set up with dictionaries

Directory names of images are self-explanatory - boundary ones are all the ones on the boundary,
while the other directories are the 10 closest to the inside/outside of each boundary
